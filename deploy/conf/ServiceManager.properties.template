#By default, the service manager will scan all classes in the CLASSPATH while looking for controller
#This can be a time consuming operation. The scanFilters help in narrowing the scope of this scanning
#Enter the pkg names where controllers can be found
#Each separate package will be in separate lines
#If scanfilter entries are present, then we will scan only the classes in these packages
#If scanfilter entries are not present at all, then all classes in the classpath will be scanned
#If the value of a scanfilter starts with character '!' then all classes in the specified package are ignored

#This flag, indicates if the service manager instance is going to run in stand alone mode or not. 
#Stand alone mode is useful when a developer wants to test a service manager instance w/o it registering itself with
#the registry, responding to heartbeats etc etc
#Set this flag to false or remove flag from this file, if the service manager instance is being deployed in QA/production
#If this flag is not there, then the instance is in stand alone mode

#The 'scope' property defines the scope of this controller. Valid values are GLOBAL / LOCAL
##scope=GLOBAL

#The 'tracker-path' property defines the path used in Event Tracking  Should be simple string, it will
#be dot separated and combined with others to form a complex path

#This URL tells service manager where global registry is located; this will be used for home grown

#This comma separated host:port combo gives the list zookeeper instances this service manager can talk to
#It is expected that each service manager will be configured with one such list for each data center 
##zookeeper-instance-list-SLC=localhost:2181

#This URL lets the service manager instance inform global registry about its VIP. This is not mandatory, but
#If configured, will save some CPU cycles for the registry (which, otherwise, will have to do a reverse lookup
#from ODB based on this service manager instance's host, port information)
##vip-url=http://localhost:8080

#This tells the location where the instance is present. Valid values are SLC, PHX, LVS. This is not mandatory, but
